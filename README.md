# BuddyJ101.github.io
Welcome to my personal portfolio website – powered by GitHub Pages!

## 🚀 What's This?
This repo hosts the source code for my interactive personal website. It's a single-page web app with a fun, minimal, and quirky design (very me). The site serves as my digital portfolio, showcasing who I am, what I do, and what I’ve built.

## 🌐 Site Features
The website kicks off with a terminal-inspired intro page – full of personality, fake "loading errors", and a prompt to hit Enter (or tap on mobile) to access the main content. From there, it's a scrollable single-page experience with the following sections:

### 🏠 Home
- Quick intro to who I am.

- Cool animated code snippet section that reflects my dev background.

### 👨‍💻 About
- A deeper dive into who I am.

- Includes a downloadable CV and a custom action figure of me (because why not?).

### 🎓 Education
- My academic background.

### 💡 Projects
- A carousel of my key projects.

- Each project displays tech used (with icons), plus a short description.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Showcases my frontend, backend, database, and dev tools.

- Cleanly organized and visualized.

### 📬 Contact Me
- Buttons to email me or WhatsApp me – redirects included for easy access.

## 📌 Tech Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

- JS for interactivity (carousel, section switching, dynamic updates)

- Fully responsive and mobile-friendly

## 📅 Future Enhancements
- Add dark/light mode toggle

- Transition animations

- Possibly blog or CMS integration

- Easier project updates via JSON or CMS
